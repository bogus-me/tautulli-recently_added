# üìö plexnote.py ‚Äì Discord Notifications for Plex via Tautulli *(multilingual support in development via centralized output system)*

> Automatically sends Discord embeds for new Plex content via Tautulli, including posters, trailers, ratings, and metadata.

---

## **üåü Goal**

This Python script sends detailed embed messages to a Discord channel whenever new content (movies, shows, seasons, or episodes) is added to your Plex library. It is triggered by Tautulli and uses TMDB for rich metadata.

---

## **1. üìÇ Prepare the Script Folder**

Navigate to your Tautulli config folder:

```
cd /path/to/tautulli/config/
```

Create the `scripts/` folder if it doesn‚Äôt exist:

```
mkdir -p scripts
```

---

## **2. üìú Download the Script**

Download `plexnote.py` and save it into:

```
tautulli/config/scripts/plexnote.py
```

Make it executable:

```
chmod 755 tautulli/config/scripts/plexnote.py
```

---

## **3. üîî Create a Discord Webhook**

1. Open Discord and go to your server.
2. Create or choose a text channel (e.g., `#plex-activity`).
3. Click the gear icon ‚Üí **Integrations** ‚Üí **Webhooks**
4. Click **"New Webhook"**
5. Give it a name (e.g. `PlexBot`) and assign the correct channel.
6. Click **"Copy Webhook URL"**

Example:

```
https://discord.com/api/webhooks/123456789012345678/AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz
```

Paste this into the script as `WEBHOOK_URL`.

---

## **5. üîç Where to Get Your Keys and IDs**

### **üîê Tautulli API Key**

1. Open **Tautulli**
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Web Interface**
3. Your API key is listed under **API Key**

---

### **üèõÔ∏è Plex Server ID**

1. Go to: [https://app.plex.tv/desktop](https://app.plex.tv/desktop)
2. Click any library (e.g., Movies)

```
https://app.plex.tv/desktop/#!/media/1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678/com.plexapp.plugins.library?source=28
```

The string after `/media/` is your **Plex Server ID**.

```
1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
```

Paste this into `PLEX_SERVER_ID`.

---

### **üéÆ TMDB API Key**

1. Register at [https://www.themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org)
2. Go to [https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
3. Apply for a **Developer** key
4. Use the **API Key (v3 auth)** in `TMDB_API_KEY`

---

### **‚öôÔ∏è Configure the Script**

Open `plexnote.py` and update these lines near the top:

```
WEBHOOK_URL      = "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."  # Your Discord webhook
TAUTULLI_URL     = "http://localhost:8181"                  # Your Tautulli URL
TAUTULLI_API_KEY = "..."                                    # API key from Tautulli
PLEX_BASE_URL    = "https://app.plex.tv"                    # Plex app URL
PLEX_SERVER_ID   = "..."                                    # Your Plex Server ID (see below)
TMDB_API_KEY     = "..."                                    # Your TMDB API key
```

To customize the fallback placeholder image:

1. Upload an image into any Discord channel (e.g. drag & drop a wallpaper).
2. Right-click the uploaded image and select **"Copy Link"**.
3. Paste this link into the `PLACEHOLDER_IMG` line inside `plexnote.py`:
3.1 Poster Example: https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp7617642.png"

```
PLACEHOLDER_IMG = "https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/..."
```

Make sure the link is public and ends in `.jpg`, `.png` or similar.

## **üß† Automatic Duplicate Protection (**\`\`**)**

The script creates a `posted.json` file in the same folder:

* Prevents duplicates by tracking `rating_key` and signature
* Keeps up to 200 entries, older ones are trimmed
* Uses file locking (`fcntl`) to avoid race conditions
* Sets safe permissions automatically

No manual setup needed ‚Äì it‚Äôs fully automatic.

---

## **üõ†Ô∏è Add the Script to Tautulli**

To connect the script with Tautulli, follow these steps:

1. Open **Tautulli**
2. Go to **Settings** in the left sidebar
3. Click **Notification Agents**
4. Click **Add a new notification agent**
5. Choose **Scripts** from the list
